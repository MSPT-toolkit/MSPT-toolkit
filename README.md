MSPT: Mass-sensitive particle tracking

This package provides a complete MSPT analysis routine for mass photometry movies, including:

- Static background removal
- Particle detection and localization
- Linking of localizations into trajectories using trackpy
- Mean squared displacement and jump distance distribution analysis of the trajectories
- Visualization of the distributions of molecular mass and diffusion coefficient of single particles
