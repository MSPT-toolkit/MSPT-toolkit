# MSPT: Mass-sensitive particle tracking
========================

##### This package provides a complete MSPT analysis routine for mass photometry movies, including:

- [x] Rolling median-based background removal
- [x] Particle detection and localization
- [x] Linking of localizations into trajectories using [`trackpy`](http://soft-matter.github.io/trackpy/v0.5.0/)
- [x] Mean squared displacement and jump distance distribution analysis of the trajectories
- [x] Visualization of the correlation of molecular mass and diffusion coefficient of single particles
- [x] Batch processing

##### The MSPT-toolkit was used for data analysis in:
* [`Mass-sensitive particle tracking to elucidate the membrane-associated MinDE reaction cycle`](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01260-x) - _Nature Methods (2021)._
